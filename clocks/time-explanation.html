      <h1>Why 24 hours, 60 minutes, 60 seconds?</h1>
      <div class="section">
        <p>The division of the day into 24 hours and the hour into 60 minutes (and the minute into 60 seconds) is the result of historical conventions mixed with practical convenience.</p>

        <h3>24-hour day</h3>
        <p>Ancient Egyptians used a 24-hour day based on 12 hours of day and 12 of night, linked to observations of the sun and stars. That practice carried forward through Greek and Roman timekeeping and became standard.</p>

        <h3>Base-60 for minutes and seconds</h3>
        <p>The base-60 (sexagesimal) system traces to the ancient Sumerians and Babylonians. Sixty factors evenly (1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30), which made division convenient for early astronomers and mathematicians, and this influence persisted in measuring angles and time.</p>

        <h3>Why it stuck</h3>
        <p>Once mechanical clocks and later global standards were built on those conventions, changing them would be costly and confusing — so the system persisted.</p>

        <div class="quote">
          <strong>Practical note:</strong> Many modern systems (computers, clocks) still rely on those divisions for historical compatibility and because they map well to human daily cycles.

Create a web page that looks and behaves exactly like the following binary clock implementation:

- The page title should be "Binary Clock".

- Use a dark gradient background (linear-gradient(135deg, #222, #444)) and white text (#fff).

- Center the content vertically and horizontally.

- Display a large heading "Binary Clock" with a green glow effect.

- Show the current time in digital format (HH:MM:SS) above the clock, styled in cyan with a glow.

- Below, display three columns labeled "Hours", "Minutes", and "Seconds".

- Each column contains 8 boxes representing binary digits (128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1), styled as squares with rounded corners.

- Lit ("on") bits are bright green with a glow; unlit ("off") bits are dark gray.

- The binary digits update every second to reflect the current time in binary for each unit.

- Include a short explanation below the clock: "Each column represents a digit of the time (HH:MM:SS). The lit up dots show which powers of 2 add up to that digit. For example, if the number is 7, the dots for 4, 2, and 1 will be lit (4+2+1=7)."

- Make the page responsive for mobile devices.

- Use only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks or external libraries.

- Match all colors, layout, and behavior exactly as described above.

Build a web site called "Time Systems Playground" from scratch. The site should include:

1. A landing page with a welcome message, a brief explanation of the site, and a relevant image or illustration.

2. A navigation menu that loads the following pages in an iframe and highlights the active menu item:

   - Home

   - Binary Clock

   - Octal Clock

   - Hexadecimal Clock

   - Decimal Clock

   - Swatch Internet Time

   - Time System Explanation

3. Each clock page should display the current time in its respective numeral system, updating every second. Use modern, readable styling and ensure accessibility.

4. The Time System Explanation page should clearly explain the historical and practical reasons for the 24-hour day, 60-minute hour, and 60-second minute, with engaging text and visuals.

5. The color scheme across all pages should be unified, using a dark gradient background (e.g., linear-gradient(135deg, #222, #444)) and white text (#fff).

6. The site should be responsive and visually appealing on both desktop and mobile devices.

7. Include a README.md describing the site, its features, and instructions for running locally.

8. Do not include any legacy or old files in navigation or documentation.

Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only. Do not use any frameworks or external libraries. All code should be original and well-commented.
